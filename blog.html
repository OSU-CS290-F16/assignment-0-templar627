<h1>Assignment 0 - Sep-26-16 </h1>
<p>
  For this first assignment, I had some issues figuring out how to setup the website. However, 
  by looking on Piazza and the webpages provided I was able to figure it out. Also, I had some issues
  with github at first, but after I did the tutorials and read some supplemental material, I eventually
  got everything working. As for websites that were helful I used the w3schools site to search for tags
  and to use their html tester so that I didn't have to constantly open up the files in Chrome. Although,
  moving forward I should probably move towards actually using a browser rather than a web based program.
